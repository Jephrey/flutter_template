# flutter_template
Template Flutter Project

This is an almost empty template project for Flutter.
Mainly for myself to quickly start a new project.
It has a homepage and a second page.

You can use it as you like for you own projects.

It uses the following packages:
* GetX for themes, state management, navigation and more
* get_storage for storing variables
* mockito for testing
* build_runner for testing, required by mockito
* flutter_launcher_icons to create the app icon
